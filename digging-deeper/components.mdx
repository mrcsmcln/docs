## Introduction

Components are the building block of websites. Think of them like self-contained units with _properties_ we can use to control their content, behavior, and appearance. Components can be defined once and used anywhere.

Here is a link component, which accepts a `url` and `text` property:

```twig
<a href="{{ url }}">{{ text }}</a>
```

Now we pass some data into the component:

```json
{
  "text": "Apply now",
  "url": "https://makebelieve.edu/apply"
}
```

This produces the following component _instance_:

```html
  <a href="https://makebelieve.edu/apply">Apply now</a>
```
