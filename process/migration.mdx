## Introduction
Migration is the process of moving data from one location to another. This process occurs after the Development phase.

## Definitions

### Sources
A source is where data exists before it is migrated. Common data sources include an old website, spreadsheets, and text documents.

### Destinations
A destination is where data will exist after it is migrated. Most web projects have only a single data destination—the new website.

### Collections
A collection is a group of similarly-structured content. The elements of a collection are called *items*. Pages, articles, and programs are all examples of collections.

<Note>Different CMSes use different terms to refer to collections. In WordPress, collections are called post types. In Drupal, they're called content types. For consistency, we will use the term *collection* throughout this documentation.</Note>

### Taxonomies
A taxonomy is a data structure used to organize collections. The elements of a taxonomy are called *terms*. Tags and categories are examples of commonly-used taxonomies.

Consider a university website that groups it programs by categories. In this example, *programs* is the collection and *categories* is the taxonomy.

Taxonomies can be either flat or hierarchical. Flat taxonomies are a simple list of unrelated terms, while the terms of hierarchical taxonomies may have parent-child relationships. Tags are generally flat, while categories are often hierarchical.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tags (flat taxonomy)">
    - Design inspiration
    - Fashion advice
    - Headphone reviews
    - Personal finance
    - Shower thoughts
    - Summer vacation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Categories (hierarchical taxonomy)">
    - Foods
      - Italian
        - Lasagna
        - Risotto
      - Mexican
        - Burritos
        - Tacos
    - Sports
      - Basketball
      - Football
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Associations
An association is a relationship between a collection item and a taxonomy term. For example, if an article (collection item) belongs to a category (taxonomy term), we call that relationship an association.

Consider the following lists of programs and locations:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Programs (collection)">
    - Applied Mathematics
    - Computer Science
    - Biomedical Engineering
  </Card>
  <Card title="Locations (taxonomy)">
    - New York
    - Los Angeles
    - Chicago
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These two lists above don't tell us which programs belong to which categories. For that relationship, we need a list of associations:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Associations">
    - Applied Mathematics ↔ New York
    - Applied Mathematics ↔ Los Angeles
    - Computer Science ↔ New York
    - Computer Science ↔ Chicago
    - Biomedical Engineering ↔ Los Angeles
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

With the list above, we see that Applied Mathematics is offered in New York and Los Angeles, but not Chicago.

## Planning
A successful migration begins with the proper preparation.

### Sale
Migration planning begins during the Sale phase. At this point, the total number of data sources and destinations should be specified. We should also specify whether we will be migrating [associations](#associations). Associations generally require an additional data source.

This puts guardrails on the project and gives us an idea for the amount of effort needed.

### Strategy
During the Strategy phase, we determine which specific collections will be migrated and how they will be migrated.

For each collection, the following concerns need to be addressed:

- What is the data source?
- What is the data destination?
- Which migration [technique](#techniques) will we use?

### Design
Migration must also be considered during the Design phase, as the design must support the data to be migrated. We should check for the following:

- Collections
- Taxonomies


## Migration types

### Local migration
Migration should first be performed locally. This enables rapid debugging and mitigates the risk of data loss.

### Server migration
Once the developer has a migration process working on their local machine,  a working migration

### Final migration


## Cadence
Migration is performed on a per-collection basis. The type of migration determines when it is performed. For example, all pages get migrated at once, and may occur at any time during development.

## Exporting data


## Importing data
Depending on the complexity of the data to be migrated, developers may opt to either use a plugin or write a custom script to perform the migration.

### Migration plugins
For simple migrations, a

### Migration scripts

### Manual migration
Manual migration is the most time-consuming technique as it requires a human to manually enter content in the destination CMS. As such, it should be avoided at all costs.


## Testing
It is extremely important to test that the migration has been performed successfully.
